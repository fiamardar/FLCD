"""
The data structured used in representation is HashTable.
It will contain a hash function and a dictionary of elements.
The hash function will calculate the hash code for each element.
This hash code will be calculated as the sum of the ASCII codes of each character in the element.
The elements dictionary has the hash code as the key, and as a value it can have either a
single element associated with this hash code, or a list of elements associated with it.
As operations, I implemented add, search and delete.
